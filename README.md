# Quick Trip
> Quick Trip is an applet that gives a general overview of the top 20~30 destinations of a given input.
> Users can choose as many destinations as they can visit within a day and the results are plotted onto a leaflet map.
> The map displays how close/far each point is from each other, giving the user a better idea of how to plan their trip.
